    def: allows a class to pass the information a different class.

    What's inherited? ->     all public variables and methods,
                             all protected variables and methods,
                             any default variable and method in same package

    What's NOT inherited? -> constructor
                             all private variables and methods
                             any default variables and methods outside the package

   Can you have multiple parents in Java? -> No, only one direct parent.
   All Classes are sub Classes of object class.

   Constructor is not inherited: -> to create object we need to call parent constructor always using Super();
