    GIT: Version Control System -> keeps track of all changing.
    GitHub: online platform that hosts our remote repositories.
    Local repo: folder on our computer that keeps track of changes
    Remote repo: online folder that keeps track of changes, others can share their changes
    -> we use GitHub to host

    UnVersioned file: not being kept track of
    Commit: Saving your changes to local Repo
    Commit Message: What changes (we are saving, we made)
    Author: who made the commit
    Push: sending changes from local repo to remote repo
    Remote: actual project (link)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Steps To Follow:
    1- Enable VCS: Enable Git -> creating local repo
    2- Create .gitignore: contains files we don't want to keep track of.
    3- Commit
    4- Share project on GitHub (done once)
            Sharing does these steps:
            1) Creates Remote Repo
            2) Links Remote repo to our project
            3) Pushes changes so far

    flow of commit and push (from Local to Remote)
        create a new package
        create a new file
        commit
        create another new file
        commit
        push all changes

    flow of Pull (fetch) -> (Remote to Local)
        Go to project (open src file) on GitHub
        add file -> create new java file
            name: loops.java
        commit that file on bottom of page

    fetch: gives us information about the commit (preview) without putting changes to our project
    update: gets the new changes for that branch
    pull: more functionality to control which branch you pull from or to

    Branches:
        1) Make new branch from Master
        2) Make sure to check out new branch
        3) Make new changes and push
        4) go to gitHub and create pull request to merge our origin name branch and master branch (origin is remote)

    checkout: switch the branch
    Head: current branch you are looking at
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Clone:  create copy of a remote repo to your local repo

    To clone office hours:
    1) go to gitHub
    2) click on account from top right
    3) settings -> developer settings
