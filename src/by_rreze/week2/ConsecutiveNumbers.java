3.Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
Write a function:

that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
======================================
//number divisible by 2 -> Codility
    //3 -> Test
    //5 -> Coders
    // 2 & 3 ->  CodilityTest
    //2,3 and 5 -> CodilityTestCoders.
For example, here is the output for N = 24:
1
Codility
Test
Codility
Coders
CodilityTest
7
Codility
Test
Codi1ityCoders
11
CodilityTest
13
Codility
TestCoders
Codility
17
